## Common First Questions

### "How do I deploy this?"
â†’ Follow SETUP.md sections 1-5. Start with local testing, then Vercel deployment.

### "I'm getting build errors"
â†’ Ask for specific error message and check:
- Are all env vars in Vercel?
- Did they run `npm install`?
- Is Node.js 18+ installed?

### "How do I set up Sanity?"
â†’ Follow SETUP.md section 3. Run `npm run studio:deploy`

### "AI features aren't working"
â†’ Check:
- Is Anthropic API key valid?
- Are API routes accessible? (test `/api/rss/aggregate`)
- Check Vercel function logs for errors

### "Where do I add content?"
â†’ Sanity Studio (either local `npm run studio` or deployed at sanity.studio)

## Typical Deployment Flow

1. User fills in remaining API keys in `.env.local`
2. Runs `npm install` and `npm run dev` to test locally
3. Runs Supabase schema in Supabase dashboard
4. Deploys Sanity Studio (`npm run studio:deploy`)
5. Pushes to GitHub
6. Connects GitHub repo to Vercel
7. Adds env vars to Vercel dashboard
8. Deploys to production
9. Sets up cron jobs for AI automation
10. Creates first content in Sanity Studio

---

## How to Help Effectively

1. **Always ask which step they're on** from SETUP.md
2. **Request specific error messages** - don't guess
3. **Check the basics first:**
   - Did they add all env vars to Vercel?
   - Did they run the Supabase schema?
   - Is Sanity Studio accessible?
4. **Reference existing files** - don't rewrite what's already there
5. **Test one thing at a time** - isolate issues

---

## Emergency Debugging

If totally stuck, ask user to check:

**Vercel Logs:**
- Dashboard â†’ Deployments â†’ [latest] â†’ Functions
- Copy full error message

**Local Console:**
- Run `npm run dev`
- Open browser console
- Copy any errors

**Sanity Status:**
- Can they access https://lnls.sanity.studio?
- Can they create content?

**Supabase Status:**
- Are all 5 tables present?
- Can they query `ai_news_stream`?

---

## Success Metrics

User is successful when:
- âœ… Site loads at their Vercel domain
- âœ… Can access Sanity Studio and create content
- âœ… Articles appear on homepage
- âœ… AI routes return 200 status
- âœ… No console errors on homepage

**Remember:** Everything is already built. This is deployment and configuration only. Don't rebuild components or routes unless there's a specific bug.

**User's Work Style:** Direct, operational, hates fluff. Give solutions, not explanations. If asked to execute, just do it.
